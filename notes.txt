MOVIEPICKER - Notes

1. Need to be able to choose where to get the data from as well as filtering it.
	1.1. Importing CSV file, using external API etc. Need an option for this that is clear to see.
	1.2. Interaction needs to be clean, try different 2-3 iterations for each big feature

2. Exporting CSV from imdb doesnt give the movie plot, but the omdbapi does. To make this work as well as possible, the
app will only support CSV in the format that IMDB exports in, since missing info from the file will be collected from the OMDB RESTful API.

3. App needs to focus in accessibility for people with disabilities, and should follow the guidelines from WCC and
Android in terms of usability and design.

4. Use 1 custom activity for tab bar / toolbar and then let other activies inherit these.

5. Dont use copyrighted images of movies, but instead free icons representing the genre of the movie! (Also remember
to credit the author for each icon!).
