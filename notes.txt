MOVIEPICKER - Notes

1. Need to be able to choose where to get the data from as well as filtering it.
	1.1. Importing CSV file, using external API etc. Need an option for this that is clear to see.
	1.2. Interaction needs to be clean, try different 2-3 iterations for each big feature

2. Exporting CSV from imdb doesnt give the movie plot, but the omdbapi does. To make this work as well as possible, the
app will only support CSV in the format that IMDB exports in, since missing info from the file will be collected from the OMDB RESTful API..
